# Python-Projects
Here are my Python Projects from The Tech Academy. In here I dive into Python, Django, tkinter, and a little of sqlite3.

Below are a few projects that I would like to highlight the most:

-Using tkinter and Python to automate moving files from one place to another based on when they were last edited:

- Created a functioning banking app using Django and Python. Able to create a user, and remember all relevant information for that user like deposits, withdrawal history:

These are just a few, feel free to check out all the other ones.
